WebDriver Helper
================

WebDriverHelper is a wrapper class around the WebDriver object to help support methods like Explicit waits in Selenium / WebDriver.

It also provides wrapper methods to simplify Predicate and FluentWaits / ExpectedConditions which helps ease in testing asynchronous scenarios in dynamic web pages, which is arguably the trickiest problem in automated testing.

Apart from that it also contains other useful methods, such as Window switching, Javascript scrolling (To fix issues with Chrome testing), and the like.

Pre-requisites
==============

Maven is required to pull the dependencies from Selenium

Java, of course

A web browser such as Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer. (Preferably Firefox)

Examples
========

Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to put in a concrete example yet, but as for now you can peruse the simple JUnit test I have written (called SimpleTest)

Alternatively you may also run the BDD version of the test by running CucumberTest (this is an example running with Cucumber-JVM)

More to come
============

Also more useful methods such as HTML table data comparisons, to be used with BDD tools like Cucumber-JVM or JBehave, or just for normal assertion purposes.



ImageMagickCompareUtil
======================

ImageMagickCompareUtil is an attempt to do image based testing on a website to ensure that no changes has occurred to the layout of the website. At present the implementation is very naive and flawed, but it is a starting point.

One to one comparisons would work without any issues.

It will work on web pages that have different heights or different widths, provided that one is a sub-set of the other. For example:

```
Image A: 300x400 px
Image B: 305x400 px // Works as A is a sub-image (Size wise) of B
```

OR

```
Image A: 400x300 px
Image B: 305x300 px // Works as B is a sub-image (Size wise) of A
```

It will NOT work on web pages with dynamic elements of varying sizes or varying width and height. For example:

```
Image A: 300x400 px
Image B: 295x405 px // Cannot work as width is less, but height is greater... which means B cannot be sub-image of A or vice-versa
```

Pre-requisites
==============

You must have ImageMagick installed on your machine.

Usage
=====

Modify ImageMagickCompareUtil.java's PATH_TO_IM_BINARY constant and point it to your ImageMagick's binary path as appropriate.

By default the screenshots are saved at a folder called screenshot in the root folder of this project.

You can run ScreenshotTest which opens Facebook's main page and help page which will then capture the screenshots and save them at screenshot/actual folder.

Create a screenshot/expected folder and copy the files over as your first expected screenshots. Run ScreenshotTest again, which will overwrite your previous screenshot.

Now create a screenshot/diff folder (Leave it empty).

By default the actual and expected screenshots are filtered with the actual_ and expected_ prefix respectively. This can be removed by setting the ACTUAL_SCREENSHOT_FILE_PREFIX and EXPECTED_SCREENSHOT_FILE_PREFIX constants to be empty strings.

You can then run ImageMagickCompareUtil's compareAndCaptureResults() by invoking

```
new ImageMagickCompareUtil().compareAndCaptureResults();
```

The results are saved in the screenshot folder to a file called results.csv
